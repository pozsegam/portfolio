Hey, My name is Mate I'm a Front-End Developer located in Hungary.
I've always liked designing things, and creating stuff, and it all started with photography.
When i got my first camera, I couldn't stop creating memories with that 5Mpx beast. 
Later my brother introduced me to the world of Photoshop, 
and started merging and blending photographs together, creating these interesting stories and compositions.
I quickly realized my passion for design. In middle school my friends and I took extra IT lessons,
and that's when i first met with programming. We coded simple algorithms in Pascal,
but I had a hard time understanding basic for loops let alone nested for loops. 
2 years later, I started my studies at University of Szeged as a Computer Science Engineer.
In the first semester, I had the pleasure to learn C. To tell the truth, 
I questioned my choices in life when We reached the part about memory management.
Things changed quickly in the second semester, when we started a web development course.
I remember coding a Peaky Blinders fan page as our final project, and i had a ton of fun.
Later in my career as a Computer Science Engineer student, I took a course called Computer Graphics,
which was about ThreeJs.
