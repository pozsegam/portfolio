Hey, My name is Mate I'm a Front-End Developer located in Hungary.
I've always liked designing things, and creating stuff, and it all started with photography.
When i got my first camera, I couldn't stop creating memories with that 5Mpx beast. Later my brother introduced me to the world of Photoshop, and started merging and blending photographs together, creating these interesting stories and compositions. I quickly realized my passion for design. In middle school my friends and I took extra IT lessons, and that's when i first met with programming. We coded simple algorithms in Pascal, but I had a hard time understanding basic for loops not to mention nested for loops. 2 years later, I started my studies at University of Szeged as a Computer Science Engineer.
